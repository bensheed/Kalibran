# Authentication Token Storage Fix

## Problem
Users were experiencing "Authentication error: No token found" when trying to create a board, even after successfully logging in. The console logs showed:

- Login was successful and token was received from backend
- `isAuthenticated` was set to `true` 
- But `token` in the auth store was `undefined`

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/src/frontend/src/store/authStore.ts`. The `login` function was using `useAuthStore.getState()` inside the store definition itself, which created a circular reference and prevented the token from being properly stored in the Zustand state.

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
login: (token: string) => {
    set({ isAuthenticated: true, token });
    console.log('Auth state after setting:', useAuthStore.getState().isAuthenticated); // ❌ Circular reference
    // ...
}
```

## Solution
Fixed the circular reference by using the `get` parameter provided by Zustand instead of calling `useAuthStore.getState()`:

```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>((set, get) => ({ // ✅ Added 'get' parameter
    // ...
    login: (token: string) => {
        console.log('Setting isAuthenticated to true with token:', token);
        set({ isAuthenticated: true, token });
        
        // Use get() instead of useAuthStore.getState() to avoid circular reference
        const state = get(); // ✅ Use get() instead
        console.log('Auth state after setting:', state.isAuthenticated);
        console.log('Token after setting:', state.token);
        // ...
    },
    // ...
}));
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Added Authentication Initialization
Added `initializeAuth()` method to restore authentication state from cookies or localStorage when the app starts:

```typescript
initializeAuth: () => {
    // Try to restore authentication state from cookie or localStorage
    const cookieToken = getTokenFromCookie();
    const storageToken = getTokenFromStorage();
    
    const token = cookieToken || storageToken;
    
    if (token) {
        console.log('Initializing auth with existing token:', token);
        set({ isAuthenticated: true, token });
        
        // Ensure cookie is set if we got token from localStorage
        if (!cookieToken && storageToken) {
            document.cookie = `session_id=${token}; path=/; max-age=86400`;
        }
    } else {
        console.log('No existing token found during initialization');
        set({ isAuthenticated: false, token: null });
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated App Component
Modified `/src/frontend/src/App.tsx` to use the new `initializeAuth()` method instead of manually handling token restoration.

### 3. Simplified CreateBoard Component
Removed redundant cookie checking logic from `/src/frontend/src/components/CreateBoard/CreateBoard.tsx` since the auth store now handles this properly.

## Files Modified

1. `/src/frontend/src/store/authStore.ts` - Fixed circular reference and added initialization
2. `/src/frontend/src/App.tsx` - Updated to use `initializeAuth()`
3. `/src/frontend/src/components/CreateBoard/CreateBoard.tsx` - Simplified authentication checks

## Testing
Created and ran comprehensive tests that confirmed:
- ✅ Token is properly stored in auth state after login
- ✅ Token persists in cookies and localStorage
- ✅ Authentication state is properly restored on app initialization
- ✅ API service can retrieve token from both store and cookie fallback
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User logs in successfully
2. Token is properly stored in Zustand state, cookies, and localStorage
3. User can create boards without "No token found" errors
4. Authentication persists across page refreshes
5. Logout properly clears all stored authentication data

## Security Notes
- Tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies for API requests
- localStorage is used as a backup for state persistence
- Tokens have appropriate expiration times (24 hours)
- All authentication data is properly cleared on logout
